My dotfiles configurations

## NeoVim
I configurated it to use instead of usual IDE. Before I used VSCode, but now, for me this neovim configurations is more convenient.
This has some plugins to make neovim more convinient. For exemple plugin to move in tabs, and i use the same plugin in tmux.

## Tmux
This is also configurated to use instead of usual IDE. But here need to install some plugins.

## .zshrc
My configuration of the .zashrc file. Also i use ```oh my zsh```
